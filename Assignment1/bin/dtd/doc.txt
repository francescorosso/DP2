# DP2Cluster - DataTypes documentation (DTD) - October 31, 2012
#
# Attached to this file you should find:
#   cluster.dtd -> DataType DTD
#   cluster.xml -> DataType example, following the DTD 
#

Main rules used to design the DTD:
* Have a main element for each group of same elements that works as a "root-element" for that group.
  This simplifies the visual and conceptual separation of different elements.
* Large usage of attributes to improve readability.
* Large usage of IDs-IDREFs in order to avoid redundancy.
* CamelCase naming convention for attributes keys.
* Uppercase naming convention for enumerations values.

Finally, the XML structure (elements with multiplicity, for attributes see "cluster.dtd" attached) is the following:

cluster (1)
    |
    + hosts (?)
    |    |
    |    + host (*)
    |
    + jobGroups (1)
    |    |
    |    + jobGroup (+)
    |
    + jobs (?)
         |
         + job (*)
         
 Notes:
 * At least one jobGroup with name "default" must be present.
 * Such this DTD requires the jobGroup "default" definition, otherwise it should not work properly.
